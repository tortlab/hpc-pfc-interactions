# Hippocampal-Prefrontal Interactions during Spatial Decision-Making

## THIS REPO IS STILL IN BETA VERSION, PLEASE WAIT

Here you can find the matlab scripts to reproduce all the figures in this paper: https://biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.168732v1 . Questions and suggestions should be sent to lucastavares@neuro.ufrn.br

## Getting Started

In each folder you will find two different scripts: one for reproducing the figures from the already processed data which is also present in the folder, and one with the functions used to process the data from the dataset. Please note that the aesthetics of the figures will differ from those in the paper due to the latter being further processed in image editors.

### Data used

This paper and the scripts found here were entirely based on shared data previously recorded and available here: https://crcns.org/data-sets/pfc/pfc-2/about-pfc-2, all the descriptions of the dataset can be found there as well.
